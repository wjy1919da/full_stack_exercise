- validation.html

validation.html is a login page that validates the username, password, and phone number.

- p2.html

Once the user enters a valid username, password, and phone number, they will be redirected to p2.html. This is a simple web page that includes a header, footer, and sidebar. The page is also responsive.

web design of header:

![Untitled](ReadMe%200b915a2cfae24f0c9e902aa8276b4948/Untitled%201.png)

The icon is clickable, which redirects the user to the login page.

mobile design of header:

![Untitled](ReadMe%200b915a2cfae24f0c9e902aa8276b4948/Untitled%202.png)

The sidebar will be stuck at the top of the web page.

![Untitled](ReadMe%200b915a2cfae24f0c9e902aa8276b4948/Untitled%203.png)

The link in the sidebar is clickable, and it will redirect the user to the corresponding section. In the mobile version the side bar will be hidden.
